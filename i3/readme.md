# Installation of i3 + urxvt theme
There are three basic directories. My installation is as follows


The configuration directory is symlinked to ~/.config/i3

urxvt/Xdefaults is symlinked to ~/.Xdefaults

As such:
```
ln -sf configuration ~/.config/i3
ln -sf urxvt/Xdefaults ~/.Xdefaults
```

# Getting a timed wallpaper (I use my buck wallpapers, not included)
Adjust your username in systemd/changewallpaper.service (now set to jeffrey)

copy the two files in the systemd directory to /usr/lib/systemd/system and enable them


As such:
```
sudo cp systemd/changewallpaper.* /usr/lib/systemd/system
sudo systemctl enable changewallpaper.timer
```
